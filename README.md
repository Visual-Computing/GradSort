### Abstract

Visually sorted grid layouts provide an efficient method for organizing high-dimensional vectors in two-dimensional space by aligning spatial proximity with similarity relationships. This approach facilitates the effective sorting of diverse elements ranging from data points to images, and enables the simultaneous visualization of a significant number of elements. However, sorting data on two-dimensional grids is a challenge due to its high complexity. Even for a small 8-by-8 grid with 64 elements, the number of possible arrangements exceeds 1.3 * 10^89 - more than the number of atoms in the universe - making brute-force solutions impractical. Although various methods have been proposed to address the challenge of determining sorted grid layouts, none have investigated the potential of gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we present a novel method for grid-based sorting that exploits gradient optimization for the first time. We introduce a novel loss function that balances two opposing goals: ensuring the generation of a "valid" permutation matrix, and optimizing the arrangement on the grid to reflect the similarity between vectors, inspired by metrics that assess the quality of sorted grids. While learning-based approaches are inherently computationally complex, our method shows promising results in generating sorted grid layouts with superior sorting quality compared to existing techniques.

The principle of permutation learning involves training a network with weights W to learn the differentiable permutation matrix P_soft based on a specified loss function. The input vectors X are rearranged into Xsort using the permutation matrix P_hard, which is a binarized version of P_soft.

We propose a combined loss function using a smoothness term (for good sorting quality) and two regularization terms (to guarantee a valid permutation matrix).

### Results

Comparison of grid-based sorting methods for different test sets based on maximum achievable average DPQ16 value (higher is better). Our new GradSort scheme was trained for up to 100,000 steps.

The following figure shows the comparison of the runtime and the achieved sorting quality of different sorting algorithms with the kitchenware image set. GradSort is our proposed gradient-based sorting scheme, GradSort T uses an additional transformer.

### Example

We provide Jupyter notebooks with full python code for the sorting algorithm for images and colors (with and without transformer):

[GradSort for Images](python/GradSort_Images.ipynb) <br>
[GradSort for Colors](python/GradSort_Colors.ipynb)

Please install the python packages listed in [python/requirements.txt](python/requirements.txt) before executing the notebook on your local machine

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We added the images and feature vectors from the sets described in the paper. Please unzip the data.zip file before running the notebooks.
